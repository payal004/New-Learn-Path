# OOPS by doodoo

## What is OOPS ? 
 - OOP in C++ was introduced to solve this problem by organizing code into
  classes and objects, making programs easier to understand, reuse, and maintain.

## Topics : 
1. Classes and objects
2. Encapsulation
3. Polymorphism
4. Abstraction
5. Inheritence

## Class : 
A class is a blueprint of objects



public Class Girl {
    private int age;

}

class BankAccount {
private:
    int balance;  // hidden data

public:
    // constructor
    BankAccount(int b) {
        balance = b;
    }

    void deposit(int amount) {
        balance += amount;
    }

    void withdraw(int amount) {
        if (amount <= balance)
            balance -= amount;
    }

    int getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
};

int main() {
    BankAccount acc(1000);

    deposit -> acc.deposit(500);

    acc.withdraw(200);

    cout << acc.getBalance(); // 1300
}
