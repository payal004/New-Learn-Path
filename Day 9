Before HTML language we had markup language
Read.md - markup language  or for writing documents 
but not interactive 
no images 
no videos can be embedded 
New Language to write research paper , so HTML was born .
HTML have only tags.
Example : heading , paragraph , bold , colors etc 

Q how to write to add .CSS into html ? 
html class .
html id #
html tag : body{} or p{}

Browser - purpose was to read research paper  read only 
IP address then research paper 
120.12.12.133/researchPaper1 

HTML / CSS
Later HTML / CSS / JS 

once html was loaded , static it was 
JAVA , c++ was already there and backend used to work .
 
Then JS was invented , JS compiler was launched on Netscape browser.



How Coding language works ?
1 High level code
2 Compiler - human readable to computer understandable code.
3 Write compiler 

Assembly language
add ,sub , * , goto 

initially JS was very slow 
so many compiler was born 

In 2008 , Google V8 engine - JS Engine 
ford v8 engine - 8 spoke engine 
V8 - fastest engine 
Open Source
chromium on GitHub - as open source code 

MIT , summer intern , Frontend - JS , backend - JAVA
Frontend mai browser v8 engine (js ka compiler) , JS se backend ka code
v8 engine ka instruction to browser

take v8 code , 
node.js 

TS And JS :

JS :
var a = 5
undefined

framework : react , express

JS see whole program at once 
var - undefined 
function as whole function

then run line by line 
and assign values to variable and functions

Functions are of 2 types :
1) abc = {fucntion}
2) 

Excel - Earlier data was stored in spreadsheet
Person1 to Person2 share the file 
if 1 cell wrong , then tell everybody to correct the value .
example 49 student same data , 1 student diff data 

Disadvantages : ACID property
- Consistency - > inconsistent data 
- time waste 
- same document mai changes done by 2 people . DB - Isolation 
- Atomicity - all or nothing , bank transfer , crypto ledger , excel of Payal - 10 , then Ashu's excel +10
- Durability -  data delete nai hona chiye 

Record making of anything 
DBMS 

Keys 
Query 
CK , SK - definition 

Normalization - breaking of table 
user ka name , mom name , papa name , order , address , mail , price

Select * from Account LIMIT 1 

harddisk (round round CD rhta hai ) 
C drive mai data rhta hai 

1NF , 2NF , 3NF , 4NF , BCNF 
processor 
wires 
harddisk 

HDD 
magnetic head
1 charged +ve
0 uncharged -ve

SSD

RAM
green color
lectrical charge

processor

harddisk se read slow
Ram se read fast , recent things get stored , cache krte h data yaha

RAM gets fitted in white wala area
motherboard mai attached RAM ,processor 

steel se HHD created 
aluminium , SSD is light weight 

global object of js 
document - 

in chrome 
iframe - object 

all tags are object
runtime mai object hota h 
inke classes are present on memory tb
---------------------------------------
event - user click on button etc 
fn - block of code {....}

innerHTML - change HTML content 
innerText

document.getElementById("GIVE ID").innerText=''; 
.innerHTML="";

document.write(1+2);

document.write if loaded after html , delete everything
therefore , write inside <script> tag </script>

window.alert(1+2);

You cannot access output devices from JavaScript

Literals - fixed value ex: "Payal" 5 
Keywords - define action to be performed . ex: let var const

JS - case sensitive
